# ITC Second Week challenge
## Probleme 01: LINUX 

Move the file named Sharing-is-caring to the directory tmp/ITC



## Probleme 02 : CRYPTOGRAPHY

It can be really simple, when you dont overthink... 
and go back to the rot of the problem ... 
can you decrypt the following ? 

vgpSYNT{s6e0g_02rc0_9er_6zc5e29a2}



## Probleme 03: LINKED LIST

Given the Sorted Linked list head which contain duplicates, the task is
to delete all the duplicate and make linked list such that every element
appear just one time.

Example:

```
Original Linked list : 1 1 2 2 3
Answer : 1 2 3
```


## Probleme 04 : ARRAYS

 Problem - Merge two sorted arrays without using extra space
Since, extra space should not be used, use the input arrays itself to perform this task
 For example: 
 
 ```
 
 If the input array is, 
                                a = [0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8]
                                b = [1 , 3 , 5 , 7]
 The output arrays should be,
                                a = [0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4]
                                b = [5 , 6 , 7 , 8]
```

 Sample Input - 1
 ```
                                a = [5 , 8 , 9 , 10]
                                b = [1 , 2 , 100]
```

Sample Output - 1

```
                                a = [1 , 2 , 5 , 8]  
                                b = [9 , 10 , 100]

```

## Probleme 05: 

Given 𝑛 points on a plane, find the smallest distance between a pair of two (different) points. 

Recall

```
the distance between points (𝑥1, 𝑦1) and (𝑥2, 𝑦2) is equal to √︀((𝑥1 − 𝑥2)² + (𝑦1 − 𝑦2)²)
```

**GOOD LUCK** 🚀
